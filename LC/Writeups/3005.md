# [LeetCode Problem: Maximum Frequency Elements](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-frequency-elements/)

**Name:** Maximum Frequency Elements  
**Time Complexity:** O(n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(n)  

---

## Problem Overview
The problem asks us to find the sum of the frequencies of the elements that appear the most in an array. In other words, we identify the maximum frequency of any element, and then add up all frequencies that match this maximum.

---

## Approach
1. **Count frequencies:**  
   Use a `HashMap<Integer, Integer>` to store how many times each number appears in the array.

2. **Track maximum frequency:**  
   While updating the map, keep track of the current maximum frequency.

3. **Sum frequencies of max elements:**  
   After building the map, iterate over its values. If a frequency equals the maximum frequency, add it to the total result.

## Implementation

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

class Solution {
    public int maxFrequencyElements(int[] nums) {
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> frequency = new HashMap<>();
        int currMaxFrequency = 0;
        int totalMaxFrequency = 0;

        // Count frequencies and track maximum
        for (int num : nums) {
            frequency.put(num, frequency.getOrDefault(num, 0) + 1);
            currMaxFrequency = Math.max(currMaxFrequency, frequency.get(num));
        }

        // Sum the counts of elements that match the max frequency
        for (Integer value : frequency.values()) {
            if (value == currMaxFrequency) totalMaxFrequency += value;
        }

        return totalMaxFrequency;
    }
}
